    <p>Manoj Tiwary, the veteran Bengal cricketer, has tried to decipher the reasons behind Virat Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) not being able to win a title in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Back in 2013, Kohli was appointed as the Challengers’ skipper after he replaced New Zealand’s Daniel Vettori. But in eight seasons, he’s yet to lead his team to glory.</p>
    
   <p> Tiwary, who last played an IPL match in 2018 for Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), feels that RCB has faltered in terms of team combination and making tactics. In the previous edition, Kohli and Co made the playoffs but were knocked out after a defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator.</p>
