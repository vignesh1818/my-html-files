python is a case sensetive programming language. Variable is should not srart with integer. And should not give space between the variables. In strings we does not change the variable , but we can change the whole string. 
  Camel case = expept the first word of string remaining are all in capital letters .
  Pascal case= all are in capital letters.
  Using the underscore between the words is Snake case.
   A variable is a box to assign a values. A array is used to store a multiple values.
    
   
   List :- it is used to store multiple values . 
          Append is used to add elements or strings at the last of the list. 
          Extend is used to add multiple strings at the last of the list. 
          Insert is used to insert values using index values in middle of the list.
          Pop is used to delete the strings using index values .
  
  set :- set is a un ordered type so it does not have index values.And its unchanged.
         And it dosent not allow duplicate values.
         And it can store different data types. 
 Finally list , tuple and set are multi stored data types.
 
 Dictionary :- it is a ordered varaible and it stored paired elements.
               We can add elements in middle of the program .
               In this we use uptate method to update the elements.
               len method use to measure the length of dictionary.
               Use clear method to empty the dictionary.
               
               
               
             If statements :-
